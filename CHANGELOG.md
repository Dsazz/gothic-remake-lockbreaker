# Changelog

All notable changes to Gothic Lock Breaker are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Release rule:** bump `VERSION` in `src/version.js`, add a dated entry below,
and update the `Current release` line in `README.md` — one commit, one deploy.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Per-tumbler cards: start hole and couplings on one plate-style card (no separate matrix).
- Holes 1–7 labeling (hole 4 = notch, 1 and 7 = walls) matching in-game counting.
- Desktop two-column layout with sticky sequence panel; mobile single-column stack.
- **Copy link** button to share the current lock via URL hash.
- Version display in the footer with changelog link.
- `scripts/check-version.js` to catch version drift across files.

### Changed

- Collapsed four panels into three: The Lock, Tumblers, The Sequence.
- Locks numbered 1 (front) through N (back), top to bottom.
- Wider responsive layout (up to 1100px) instead of a fixed 660px column.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Edge-safe BFS solver: shortest path that never grinds a pin past the frame.
- Coupling matrix UI, per-tumbler position tracks, and step-through walkthrough.
- URL hash and localStorage persistence for bookmarking and sharing locks.
